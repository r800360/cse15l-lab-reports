## Lab Report 1

Here, we demonstrate common examples of the cd, ls, and cat commands as applied to without arguments, to a directory, and to a file within the workspace that was created during the first lab session.

We begin with the cd command, which is short for "change directory". Starting at the /home/lecture1 working directory and running the command with no arguments, we have,

Here, we observe that the cd command did not produce any output because we did not specify a directory to change to as an argument for the command, so it changed to the current directory by default, which is no change overall.
It is also clear that since the output is empty, this is not an error. Having no arguments indicates no net change to the directory.

Continuing, when we start at the /home/ working directory and run the cd command with the directory containing the translated "Hello World" messages from the first lab session, we have,

Here, we observe that the cd command changed the green directory portion of the prompt from ~ (which is the /home/ working directory) to ~/lecture1/messages .  

A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
What the working directory was when the command was run
A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it's an error, explain why it's an error.
